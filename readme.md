# Story Maker
This is a web-based tool that allows you to plan characters in a transformative way--in the form of modular building blocks you get to create.

You can create character blueprints for specific stories and then design your blueprints into full character sheets.

**THIS PROJECT IN THE WORKS, ALL PARTS OF THE DESIGN AND FUNCTIONS ARE INCOMPLETE**

## Who Is This For?
Meant specifically for stories, these could be used to create custom DnD character sheets, adaptable sheets to dig deep into characters for stories, and possibly other niches I possibly would never expect.

## How to Use?
[WIP]
### Step 1 - Create Story
Stories > Add Story
- Fill in Story name, description is optional
- Then, EXIT

### Step 2 - Create Modules
Modules > CREATE MODULE
- Read the [GUIDE] for more clues
- Create as many modules you think you need for the character sheet's inputs (Create Module)
- Then, EXIT
### Step 3 - Create Modules
Modules > CREATE MODULE
### Step 4 - [WIP] Create Character Sheet
Story > Story Sheet
- Style your blueprint of the character sheet here
- Add your custom modules here
- Then, finish and save the story sheet (WIP)!
### Step 5 - [Under Construction] Create Character Sheet
Story > Character Sheet
- Under construction, however this is where you style each character's sheet, utilizing the blueprint you made with the Story Sheet
- As in... You'll incorporate all inputs of the Story Sheet to design the de facto character sheet each character will adhere to.
## Etc
Additional information will be placed here.
- Always check the "Guide" for more information (or when it gets updated)
